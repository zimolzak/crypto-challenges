the matasano crypto challenges
========

So far, the ones that use stdin are challenges number 4 and 6. The
others carry their inputs with them. Redirecting 4 and 6 to a file is
also advisable.

To do
----
* use real base64 library - use MIME::Base64;
* ceil() from POSIX
* oops, installed Crypt::OpenSSL::AES to ~/perl5

Important conclusion
--------
* Be more accurate about picking the best key size, and about the metric.
